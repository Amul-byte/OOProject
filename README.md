# OOProject

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It is designed
as a learning tool for understanding and practicing OOP principles such as encapsulation,
inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features

- Modular code structure using classes
- Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Simple command-line interface for user interaction
- Example of user registration and login system

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd OOProject
   ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. No external dependencies are required for the core OOP demonstration.

## Usage

1. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells to interact with the OOP examples.
2. Alternatively, copy the code to a `.py` file and run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to explore the OOP features.

## Notes

- This project is for educational purposes and uses in-memory storage for demonstration.
- You can extend the code to add more OOP features or real-world scenarios.
